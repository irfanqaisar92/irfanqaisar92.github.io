<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. Qianchuan Zhao. My research focuses on occupant-centric control strategies for smart buildings, aiming to optimize energy consumption and enhance indoor environmental quality through advanced machine learning approaches.

My work integrates building energy simulation, data-driven modeling, and real-time sensing systems. I have explored and applied techniques such as deep learning, transformer architectures, and large language models (LLMs) for room occupancy detection, estimation, and prediction. In particular, I have developed LLM-based models that process structured sensor data using natural language prompts to accurately forecast occupancy patterns in real-time.

Building on this foundation, I am now extending my research to integrate LLMs with occupant-centric control strategies for HVAC systems. The goal is to create intelligent, adaptive building environments that reduce energy usage while maintaining occupant comfort.

I have conducted multiple case studies using real-world datasets, contributing to the development of advanced predictive models and control strategies for smart, energy-efficient buildings. My broader academic interests include camera-based occupancy sensing, sensor fusion, and intelligent building automation.

Beyond research, I am dedicated to academic collaboration, mentoring, and sharing knowledge through teaching and international exchange.

*Buildings*, Volume 13, 2023, Article 2002  
This study presents OPTnet, a Transformer-based deep learning model that uses multi-sensor data (occupancy, environmental conditions, and HVAC control) to predict room occupancy in real time. The model outperforms decision trees, LSTM, and MLP across various time horizons, offering a robust solution for occupant-centric building control.

[**Building occupancy number prediction: A Transformer approach**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110807)

Kailai Sun, **Irfan Qaisar**, Muhammad Arslan Khan, Tian Xing, Qianchuan Zhao  
*Building and Environment*, Volume 244, 2023, 110807  
This paper proposes a Transformer-based deep learning model for multi-zone building occupancy number prediction using real-world multi-sensor data. It outperforms traditional ML methods (RF, DT, XGBoost, LSTM) and provides valuable insights for developing occupant-centric control strategies for energy-efficient buildings.

[**An experimental comparative study of energy saving based on occupancy-centric control in smart buildings**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2024.112322)

**Irfan Qaisar**, Wei Liang, Kailai Sun, Tian Xing, Qianchuan Zhao  
*Building and Environment*, Volume 268, 2025, Article 112322  
This study investigates the real-world performance of occupancy-centric HVAC control in a multi-zone smart building. By leveraging real-time camera-based occupancy data and simulating control strategies with various update intervals (5‚Äì60 minutes) using EnergyPlus and OpenStudio, the study demonstrates significant energy savings and improved thermal comfort. The work provides valuable insight into optimizing operational schedules and integrating OCC systems into real buildings.
