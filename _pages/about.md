*Buildings*, Volume 13, 2023, Article 2002  
This study presents OPTnet, a Transformer-based deep learning model that uses multi-sensor data (occupancy, environmental conditions, and HVAC control) to predict room occupancy in real time. The model outperforms decision trees, LSTM, and MLP across various time horizons, offering a robust solution for occupant-centric building control.

[**An experimental comparative study of energy saving based on occupancy-centric control in smart buildings**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2024.112322)

**Irfan Qaisar**, Wei Liang, Kailai Sun, Tian Xing, Qianchuan Zhao  
*Building and Environment*, Volume 268, 2025, Article 112322  
This study investigates the real-world performance of occupancy-centric HVAC control in a multi-zone smart building. By leveraging real-time camera-based occupancy data and simulating control strategies with various update intervals (5‚Äì60 minutes) using EnergyPlus and OpenStudio, the study demonstrates significant energy savings and improved thermal comfort. The work provides valuable insight into optimizing operational schedules and integrating OCC systems into real buildings.

[**Event-triggered H‚àû consensus control for multi-agent systems under time-varying delay**](#)

**Irfan Qaisar**, Muhammad Shamrooz Aslam, Chuan Zhou  
*Control Engineering and Applied Informatics*, Vol. 22, No. 3, 2020, pp. 25‚Äì32  

This paper presents an event-triggered control strategy for multi-agent systems with directed communication topologies and time-varying delays. A new Lyapunov-based approach with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) ensures H‚àû consensus performance while reducing communication load. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving stability and reducing data transmissions.

This paper proposes an adaptive event-triggered robust H‚àû controller for Takagi‚ÄìSugeno fuzzy Markov jump systems with time-varying delays. A novel stochastic Lyapunov‚ÄìKrasovskii functional and a delay decomposition method are introduced to improve control performance while reducing communication costs. A truck-trailer application validates the proposed design.

[**Exponential Stability for Event-triggered Consensus Control of Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems**](#)  
**Irfan Qaisar**, Chuan Zhou, Zhengqing Shi, Wei Xu, Peng Xu  
*31st Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC), 2019*  

This paper addresses the consensus control problem for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using dual event-triggered schemes. It proposes a novel exponential stability criterion based on Lyapunov methods and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing communication overhead while maintaining stability.
